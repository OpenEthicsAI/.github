# Hi there üëã

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is Open Ethics Initiative all about?

The Open Ethics Initiative is a global movement focused on promoting transparency, ethical design, and responsible deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Let me break down what it‚Äôs all about:

### Mission and Purpose:
The Open Ethics Initiative aims to engage various stakeholders, including citizens, legislators, engineers, and subject-matter experts. Its core mission is to foster a transparent approach to designing and deploying AI-powered solutions that positively impact society.
### Key Components:
**Inclusive Dialog**: The initiative encourages open conversations between experts and citizens. Inclusive dialogues lead to better collaboration and understanding, ensuring that humans and AI can work together effectively.

**Disclosure and Transparency Protocol**: This bottom-up approach encourages providers of AI systems to disclose their modes of operation in a standardized, user-friendly, and explicit manner. Think of it as a starting point for machines to explain themselves.

**Open Ethics Maturity Model**: Organizations can use this framework to become more transparent and ethically consistent. It outlines steps for critical self-examination of practices.

## üòª Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

### Simple steps:
1. Join us using this link https://openethics.ai/join/
2. Explore Discord conversations https://openethics.ai/discord/
3. Participate in meetups, write content or code, browse through open issues and pick the one that makes sense

### I have an idea, what to do next?
If you have an idea, pick up someone from the community to chat about it first. The best place to start is Discord. Once the idea gets crystalized, add it in the Impact Hub project in this repository and attempt to describe the features and scenarios of your idea as detailed as you can.

### How requirements should be described:
We use the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) syntax to formalize requirements. The Gherkin language is easy to read and used for writing test cases, particularly in the context of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Gherkin connects the human concept of cause and effect to the software concept of input/process and output.

The complex scenario could be described as follows using simple vocabulary of keywords:
```
Feature, Background, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, But
```
