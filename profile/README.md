# Hi there üëã

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is Open Ethics Initiative all about?

The Open Ethics Initiative is a global movement focused on promoting transparency, ethical design, and responsible deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Let me break down what it‚Äôs all about:

### Mission and Purpose:
The Open Ethics Initiative aims to engage various stakeholders, including citizens, legislators, engineers, and subject-matter experts. Its core mission is to foster a transparent approach to designing and deploying AI-powered solutions that positively impact society.
### Key Components:
**Inclusive Dialog**: The initiative encourages open conversations between experts and citizens. Inclusive dialogues lead to better collaboration and understanding, ensuring that humans and AI can work together effectively.

**Disclosure and Transparency Protocol**: This bottom-up approach encourages providers of AI systems to disclose their modes of operation in a standardized, user-friendly, and explicit manner. Think of it as a starting point for machines to explain themselves.

**Open Ethics Maturity Model**: Organizations can use this framework to become more transparent and ethically consistent. It outlines steps for critical self-examination of practices.

## üòª Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

### Simple steps:
1. Join us using this link https://openethics.ai/join/
2. Explore Discord conversations https://openethics.ai/discord/
3. Participate in meetups, write content or code, browse through open issues and pick the one that makes sense

### Where do I start from now that I am a member/contributor?

)
1. Go to Open Ethics Projects: https://openethics.ai/projects
2. Check out Impact Hub: https://orgs/OpenEthicsAI/projects/6/views/1
3. Check out the process down below if you have an idea to pitch.

### Is there a roadmap? What tasks can I work on?
We have a project management tool in the form of the task board called the _Impact Hub_. You'll get your invite as soon as you Join. To be able to navigate it better, here is everything you need to know:

You can find all the tasks in Impact Hub. 
- Each task has a size: XS ‚Äì extra small, S ‚Äì small, M ‚Äì medium, L ‚Äì large, XL ‚Äì extra large.
- Each task has a level of Priority assigned: P0 ‚Äì critical and time-sensitive, P1- important tasks that move the project forward, P2 ‚Äì tasks that are necessary for long term success &  no priority tasks ‚Äì they still need to get done, but are not key tasks. 
- All tasks fall under a specific category: Research, Development, Content, Design, Outreach or Funding. 
- All tasks have a specific status: Ready for development, To Do, In progress, Review & Done. The tasks that do not have a status yet assigned are either not yet fully described or are contingent on other tasks to be done first.
- Once you find a task that is ready for development, which has not been assigned in the category you wish to contribute to, feel free to assign it to yourself and start working on it. Some of the tasks (especially the more complex ones, such as the L & XL-sized ones) require more than one 

### I have an idea, what to do next?
**1.	Prepare a clear & concise presentation/pitch that outlines your idea**

- When you start putting together your pitch, start by providing the context. Give a brief overview of the issue or opportunity your idea addresses. This should underline how & why the idea is relevant and viable. Focus on answering the big questions: What, Where, When, Why, How. 
- Gather relevant information and insights to support your idea. Make sure you back it up with research or have a solid background to support your idea. You can use examples or use cases to highlight your proposition. 
- Be ready to have an answer to most questions that may arise to ensure your idea is well thought out.

**2.	Align it with the Open Ethics Existing Ecosystem**

- Ensure your idea integrates and aligns with our existing ecosystem and advances our goals. You can take a deeper look at our mission, vision, manifesto, current projects and Impact Hub tasks to see if and where it can best be integrated.
- Show how your idea fits either as a standalone project or it can be a part of our current ones. 
- Make sure you describe your idea as detailed as possible and try to cover all the phases (design/research, development, implementation etc.).

**3.	Share it on Discord or pick up someone from the community to chat about it first**

- The best place to start is Discord. Talk to the members & contributors of our community and run your idea by them. Based on the feedback, you can make the necessary edits to your pitch before posting it. 
- Once the idea gets crystallized after the feedback, add it in the Impact Hub project in this repository and attempt to describe the features and scenarios of your idea as detailed as you can. 
- Breaking it down into subtasks is helpful for a better understanding of it. If you have any questions regarding posting it on Impact Hub (category, task size etc.), please contact Alice at a.pavaloiu@openethics.ai.

This process ensures that your idea is well-prepared, strategically aligned, and refined through a feedback process, which can result in its successful adoption within Open Ethics ecosystem.

### Can I reuse what I contribute?
In the most cases Open Ethics Initiative is asking all contributors to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA). By signing the CLA you grant the license to Open Ethics to use your contribution but it does not change Your rights to use Your own contributions for any other purpose.

### How requirements should be described:
We use the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) syntax to formalize requirements. The Gherkin language is easy to read and used for writing test cases, particularly in the context of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Gherkin connects the human concept of cause and effect to the software concept of input/process and output.

The complex scenario could be described as follows using simple vocabulary of keywords:
```
Feature, Background, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, But
```
